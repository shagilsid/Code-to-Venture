        **Final Report:**

        Here is a sample report based on an analysis of a hypothetical project.

        **Technical Summary:**
        1.  **Project's Purpose**: The project is a Python-based web scraping tool that extracts product information from e-commerce sites.
        2.  **Key Features**: It can scrape product titles, prices, reviews, and images. It supports multiple sites and can export data to CSV.
        3.  **Technology Stack**: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests.
        4.  **Code Structure**: A main script to handle user input, a `scrapers` module for site-specific logic, and a `utils` module for data export.

        **Business Use Cases Report:**

        **1. Use Case Title: PricePulse Competitive Analysis**
        * **Target Audience**: E-commerce store owners and marketing managers.
